My task was to create a Movie API written as a class using JavaScript that should perform/offer a certain set of methods (listed below). I put 2 hours on this project. In complex applications we have different endpoints so I have used Express Wireframe which is both fast and lightweight for building applications. Also my project is based on Client Server Architecture which is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client.
📌 GET
📌 POST
📌 DELETE 
are the HTTP Methods that I used. 
An additional package that I have installed is nodemon by which the application is restarting directly after saving and I didn't do it manually. 
During my project I veryfied the results of the test in Postman. 
The 'Joi' which is a popular module for data validation, makes it easy to validate my information and returns them to the client. 

## How to Run the Project
Use `node index.js` or `nodemon index.js`

<br />

## Testing
    ✔ GET /Movies (45ms)
    ✔ GET /Movies/genre/:genre
    ✔ POST /Movies
    ✔ GET /Movies/:id

  4 passing (84ms)

<br />

✔ 1. (REQUIRED) When instantiating the class with the imported movies.json file, add an “id” and a random “rating” from 1 to 5 for each movie before storing it.
✔ 2. A method that returns movies from a certain genre.
✔ 3. A method that removes a movie with a certain id (if found).
  4. A method that returns the movies with the subtitle and thumb properties filtered out.
  5. A method that returns the movies sorted by name.
  6. A method that returns the 2 top rated movies and 2 bottom rated movies.
  7. A method that prints out the three top rated movies.
  8. A method that prints out movies sorted from bottom rated to top rated.
✔ 9. A method that allows the user to add a new movie object to the movie list (supply all properties but the “id” and    		“rating.  The “id” and “rating” properties should be added internally by the method.
✔ 10. A method that returns a movie with a certain id (if found).
  11. A method that changes the title of a movie with a certain id (if found). The updated title should be sent in as an argument to the method.
